⚙️ Whether you're a developer, project manager, or part of a digital agency, this plugin will streamline your workflow within the Webvizio ecosystem. Here is the installation guide: [https://webvizio.com/help-center/wordpress-plugin/](https://webvizio.com/help-center/wordpress-plugin/)

##Detailed Plugin Features

### ✅ Accurate Content Display

The plugin ensures that all your site content is displayed accurately within Webvizio, addressing common issues like incorrect display or missing page elements. This feature guarantees a professional and seamless viewing experience.

###🔒 Access to Password-Protected Pages

The plugin allows you to efficiently work with hidden or password-protected pages on your website within the Webvizio platform. This ensures sensitive information remains secure while still being accessible to authorized Webvizio users.

You can select a user within your site to be connected to Webvizio. After this, all Webvizio users who open the project will automatically be logged into the account of the connected user and have access to all the pages available to that WordPress user, except for the admin panel pages.

❗Important: For security reasons, we advise against connecting users with the administrator role to Webvizio. The optimal approach is to create a dedicated user account on your site specifically for Webvizio integration.

###⚡ Increased Loading Speed

By directly utilizing your website’s resources, the plugin significantly boosts tab loading speeds. Webvizio no longer creates a copy of your website page for display; instead, it uses your website directly. This ensures that the loading speed is only limited by your site's inherent performance.
